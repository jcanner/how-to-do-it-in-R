We can do this using two different features of data visualization:\n\nColor Differences\nFacets\n\n\nAdding Color to GroupsFaceting by GroupsUsing ggplot2 to Control Facets\n\n\nSimilar to changing the color of bars to a single color, we can use the fill = argument but instead specify our categorical variable z.\n\ngf_histogram(~x, \n             data = mydata,\n             fill = ~z) #don't forget the ~ before the variable name\n\nHere is the histogram of bill_length_mm with color varied by species a categorical variable with values of Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo. Modify the code below to change the fill color to another categorical variable such as island or sex and see what happens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaceting in visualization is a tool that allows you to easily split up data across multiple panels of the same type. To do this in ggformula you add | z after the formula which conditions the graph on the categorical variable z and splits the graph by the groups/values of z.\n\ngf_histogram(~x | z, \n             data = mydata)\n\nHere is the histogram of bill_length_mm with facets based on species, a categorical variable with values of Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo.

Try adding fill by the facet variable as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the ggformula option for facets does not give you much control on how to organize the facets, so it might be useful to instead of a ggplot2 option such as facet_wrap() or facet_grid. For example, here is an example using facet_wrap() that allows us to stack our facets into one column (ncol = 1). Look up the options for different facet functions and try other modification.",

Then replace bill_length_mm with another quantitative variable from the penuins data (e.g. bill_depth_mm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice the warning produced from running the code. This is just a warning that there were rows (penguins) ignored due to missing data for the variables visualized.\n\n\nAdding Labels\nDescriptive labels are important for any visualization. We can always add them to any visualization by adding xlab = to your function. Notice, for a single variable we do not add a y-axis label.\n\ngf_boxplot(~x, \n           data = mydata,\n           xlab = \"X Axis Label\",\n           title = \"Descriptive Title\") |&gt; \n  gf_theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), \n           axis.text.y = element_blank())\n\nAdd labels and a title to the histogram for bill_length_mm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Modifications\nWe can add a few other modifications that purely aesthetic - just to make our graphs look nicer or easier to read.\n\nAdding the Data Points to the Graph\nBoxplots often hide the amount of data they represent (the number of cases). To combat this, we can add the data points to the boxplot using the gf_jitter() function. You can modify the height = argument to change the distance between points. Notice the 0 which centers the points on the y-axis at 0.\n\ngf_boxplot(~x, \n           data = mydata) |&gt; \n  gf_jitter(0 ~ x, \n           data = mydata,\n           height = 1) |&gt; \n  gf_theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),  \n           axis.text.y = element_blank())   \n\nModify the values for height = agrument and see how they affect the point distribution on the y-axis. Remember, the y-axis has no meaning here, so the heights of the points are random and not representative of any element of the data. Just the position on the x-axis is meaningful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilling the Boxes with Color\nWe can add a color to fill the boxes by telling R to fill the bars with a specified color either using a built in color from R or using a hex code for colors .\n\ngf_boxplot(~x, \n           data = mydata,\n           xlab = \"X Axis Label\",\n           title = \"Descriptive Title\",\n           fill = \"darkcyan\") |&gt; \n  gf_theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), \n           axis.text.y = element_blank())\n\n\n\nChanging the Theme\nThe package ggformula is built on top of another package called ggplot2 and so any ggplot2 function can be added to a ggformula generated graphic. For example, we can change the theme to a built-in theme. To connect ggplot2 functions, we will use a + at the end of the line precedding the function.\nTry changing the theme to the following graph:",

Both will work, it is just that %&gt;% relies on another pacakge and |&gt; is built into base R.\nRun the code below to see an example using the quantitative variable bill_length_mm from the penguins data.
