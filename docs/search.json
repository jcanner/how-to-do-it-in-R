The formula based syntax means that all ggformula generated graphics will generally take the following form:\n\ngf_goal(y ~ x, data = mydata)\n\nwhere the\n\ngoal will be the specific function for the graph type (e.g. gf_histogram()),\nthe y and x will be the specific variables/columns in the data mapped to the y-axis and x-axis respectively, and\n\nmydata is the object name of your data.\n\n\n\nFirst, be sure you have installed ggformula.
