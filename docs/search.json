This is just a warning that there were rows (penguins) ignored due to missing data for the variables visualized. A Warning is simply R communicating a decision it made without your consent. The code still works.\n\n\n\n\nBin Widths\nOne of the features of a histogram is the bin width. The bin width is something that is automatically generated for most histogram functions, but it is not always ideal. You can add an argument to the R function gf_histogram() to modify the bin width.\n\ngf_histogram(~ x, \n             data = mydata, \n             binwidth = 10)  #adjust this number\n\nRun the code below to see an example using the quantitative variable bill_length_mm from the penguins data with a bin width of 5 (mm). Modify the bin width and see how it affects the histogram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding Labels\nDescriptive labels are important for any visualization.

We can do this using two different features of data visualization:\n\nColor Differences\nFacets\n\n\nAdding Color to GroupsFaceting by GroupsUsing ggplot2 to Control Facets\n\n\nSimilar to changing the color of bars to a single color, we can use the fill = argument but instead specify our categorical variable z.\n\ngf_histogram(~x, \n             data = mydata,\n             fill = ~z) #don't forget the ~ before the variable name\n\nHere is the histogram of bill_length_mm with color varied by species a categorical variable with values of Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo.

To do this in ggformula you add | z after the formula which conditions the graph on the categorical variable z and splits the graph by the groups/values of z.\n\ngf_histogram(~x | z, \n             data = mydata)\n\nHere is the histogram of bill_length_mm with facets based on species, a categorical variable with values of Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo.

Try adding fill by the facet variable as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the ggformula option for facets does not give you much control on how to organize the facets, so it might be useful to instead of a ggplot2 option such as facet_wrap() or facet_grid. For example, here is an example using facet_wrap() that allows us to stack our facets into one column (ncol = 1). Look up the options for different facet functions and try other modification.",

We can remove it using the function gf_theme()\n\ngf_boxplot(~x, \n           data = mydata) |&gt; #this is a pipe, another option is %&gt;%\n  gf_theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),  #removes y-axis ticks\n           axis.text.y = element_blank())   #removes y-axis labels\n\nNotice the use of the native pipe |&gt; to connect the two functions from ggformula. Another version of a pipe in R is %&gt;%. Both will work, it is just that %&gt;% relies on another package and |&gt; is built into base R.\nRun the code below to see an example using the quantitative variable bill_length_mm from the penguins data. Then replace bill_length_mm with another quantitative variable from the penguins data (e.g. bill_depth_mm)\n\n#| label: boxplot-one\n#| warning: true\ngf_boxplot(~bill_length_mm, \n           data = penguins) |&gt; \n  gf_theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), \n           axis.text.y = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarnings in R\n\n\n\nNotice the warning produced from running the code. This is just a warning that there were rows (penguins) ignored due to missing data for the variables visualized. A Warning is simply R communicating a decision it made without your consent. The code still works.\n\n\n\n\nAdding Labels\nDescriptive labels are important for any visualization. We can always add them to any visualization by adding xlab = to your function. Notice, for a single variable we do not add a y-axis label.\n\ngf_boxplot(~x, \n           data = mydata,\n           xlab = \"X Axis Label\",\n           title = \"Descriptive Title\") |&gt; \n  gf_theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), \n           axis.text.y = element_blank())\n\nAdd labels and a title to the boxplot for bill_length_mm.\n\n#| label: boxplot-add-labels\ngf_boxplot(~bill_length_mm, \n           data = penguins,\n           xlab = \"______________\",\n           title = \"_____________\") |&gt; \n  gf_theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), \n           axis.text.y = element_blank())\n\n\n\nOther Modifications Show\n\nWe can add a few other modifications that purely aesthetic - just to make our graphs look nicer or easier to read.\n\nAdding the Data Points to the GraphFilling the Boxes with ColorChanging the Theme\n\n\nBoxplots often hide the amount of data they represent (the number of cases). To combat this, we can add the data points to the boxplot using the gf_jitter() function. You can modify the height = argument to change the distance between points. Notice the 0 which centers the points on the y-axis at 0.\n\ngf_boxplot(~x, \n           data = mydata) |&gt; \n  gf_jitter(0 ~ x, \n           data = mydata,\n           height = 1) |&gt; \n  gf_theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),  \n           axis.text.y = element_blank())   \n\nModify the values for height = argument and see how they affect the point distribution on the y-axis. Remember, the y-axis has no meaning here, so the heights of the points are random and not representative of any element of the data. Just the position on the x-axis is meaningful.\n\n#| label: boxplot-add-jitter\ngf_boxplot(~bill_length_mm, \n           data = penguins) |&gt; \n  gf_jitter(0 ~ bill_length_mm, \n           data = penguins,\n           height = 0.25) |&gt; \n  gf_theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), \n           axis.text.y = element_blank())\n\n\n\nWe can add a color to fill the boxes by telling R to fill the boxes with a specified color either using a built in color from R or using a hex code for colors .\n\ngf_boxplot(~x, \n           data = mydata,\n           xlab = \"X Axis Label\",\n           title = \"Descriptive Title\",\n           fill = \"darkcyan\") |&gt; \n  gf_theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), \n           axis.text.y = element_blank())\n\n\n\nThe package ggformula is built on top of another package called ggplot2 and so any ggplot2 function can be added to a ggformula generated graphic.

It also measures the spread about the mean, always zero or greater than zero, and is used more often than the variance as it has the same units of measurement as the original observations.\n\\[s= \\sqrt{s^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\ x_i-\\bar{x}\\right)^2}{n-1}}\\]\n\n\n\n\nBasic Code\nFor a single quantitative variable, x, here is the general structure for calculating a standard deviation in R using the sd() function from the mosaic package.\n\nsd(~x, data = mydata)\n\nRun the code below to see an example using the quantitative variable bill_length_mm from the penguins data. Then replace bill_length_mm with another quantitative variable from the penguins data (e.g. bill_depth_mm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHandling Missing Values\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice the returned value of NA. The function needs to have another argument added that tells R to ignore missing values (NA) in order to calculate the median, na.rm = TRUE. Add the argument to the code above\n\nsd(~x, data = mydata, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Standard Deviations Across Groups\nWhen we want to calculate the standard deviation of a quantitative variable (y) measured across the values/groups of a categorical variable (x) it is a simple modification to the single standard deviation code.\n\nsd(y ~ x, data = mydata)\n\nRun the code below to see an example using the quantitative variable bill_length_mm and species from the penguins data. Then replace bill_length_mm with another quantitative variable from the penguins data (e.g. bill_depth_mm) and/or another categorical variable (e.g., sex).\nRemember to add na.rm = TRUE if you get a warning.",
