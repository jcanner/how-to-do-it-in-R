## Getting Started

First, be sure you have installed `ggformula`. Remember, you only need to install the package once on your machine.

Then, be sure to load the package `ggformula`. Remember, you need to do this with each new Quarto/RMarkdown document or R Session.

```{webr}
#| label: setup
library(ggformula) #for graphs
```


### Data for Examples

As a reminder (see [Overview of Data Visualization](visualization-overview.qmd), we will be using the `penguins` data from the `palmerpenguins` package: 

```{r}
#| label: load-penguins
library(palmerpenguins)
```

Here is a snippet of the data:

```{r}
#| label: data-structure 
#| echo: false
library(dplyr)
library(gt)
slice_sample(penguins, n = 5) |> 
  gt::gt() |> 
  gt::tab_header(title = "Palmer Penguins")
```

## Histograms with One Quantitative Variable

### Basic Code

For a single quantitative variable, `x`, here is the general structure. 

```{r}
#| label: one-var-structure
#| eval: false
gf_histogram(~x, 
             data = mydata)
```

Run the code below to see an example using the **quantitative** variable `bill_length_mm` from the `penguins` data.  

```{webr}
#| label: histogram-one
gf_histogram(~bill_length_mm, 
             data = penguins)
```

Notice the warning produced from running the code. This is just a warning that there were rows (penguins) ignored due to missing data.  


### Bin Widths

One of the features of a histogram is the **bin width**. The bin width is something that is automatically generated for most histogram functions, but it is not always ideal. You can add an *argument* to the R function `gf_histogram()` to modify the bin width.

```{r}
#| label: one-var-structure-bin
#| eval: false
gf_histogram(~ x, 
             data = mydata, 
             binwidth = 10)  #adjust this number
```

Run the code below to see an example using the **quantitative** variable `bill_length_mm` from the `penguins` data with a bin width of 5 (mm). Modify the bin width and see how it affects the histogram.  

```{webr}
#| label: histogram-one-bins
gf_histogram(~bill_length_mm, 
             data = penguins, 
             binwidth = 5)
```
